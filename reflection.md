- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
contains title, check out, add title, return book , remove title, is available, house is two overloaded contructors. 


- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
What didn't work at first in our overloading of the sell coffee constructor was the scenerio of when a coffee would be sold with size and nSugarPackets or size and nCreams. This was an issue because since the parameters for both scenerios only took in two integers so the main would not run selling the coffee since it would think the overloaded methods were duplicates of eachother. This was later fixed by just saying that the sold coffee was an Americano without considering nSugarPackets or nCreams.
